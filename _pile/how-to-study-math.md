Before we get started, play this in the background.

# 1. You’re literally a fuckin’ wizard, dawg

You’re not an undergrad who’ll get bitch-slapped by Euler or Gauss---you *are* the arcane scholar.  
A wizard holds secret knowledge and wields it. Your quill is that Apple Pen.

# 2. Math formulae are divine runic sigils

Behold the Navier–Stokes runes:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

$$
\rho \Bigl(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v}\Bigr) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

While deciphering these runes, you’re channeling the cosmos. At first, it’s chaos---a vortex of arcana—but then it *clicks*. That snap of insight? You tamed the vortex. You just acquired another runic code.

# 3. Detach yourself from reality and schizomaxx

You’re not in the 21st century. The year is 171 after the death of Himmel the Hero.  
Your lecture hall is a great hall of mystics. Every theorem you learn, you *discover*, as if whispered by wizards long gone.  
You converse with Archimedes and Hypatia in your mind’s eye—and you keep pace.

# 4. GTFO this blog and pick up the scroll

Go.

The universe isn’t going to whisper itself twice.

Before we get started, play this in the background.

# 1. You’re literally a fuckin’ wizard, dawg

You’re not an undergrad who’ll get bitch-slapped by Euler or Gauss---you're a wizard.  
A wizard holds secret knowledge and wields it. That pen (or Apple Pen) is literally your quill right now.

# 2. Math formulae are divine runic sigils

Behold the Navier–Stokes runes:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

$$
\rho \Bigl(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v}\Bigr) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

While deciphering these runes, you’re challenging the cosmos. At first, it’s chaos---a vortex of arcana—but then it clicks. A snap of insight. You tamed the vortex. You just acquired another runic code.

# 3. Detach yourself from reality and schizomaxx

You’re not in the 21st century. The year is 171 after the death of Himmel the Hero.  
Your lecture hall is The Great Hall of Mystics. Every theorem you learn, you *discover*, as if whispered by wizards long gone.  
You converse with Archimedes and Hypatia in your mind’s eye---and their secrets are being etched into your soul.

# 4. GTFO this blog and pick up the scroll

Go.

The universe isn’t going to whisper itself twice.

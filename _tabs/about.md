I'm a machine learning research engineer with a strong software engineering background.

I really love building things. I spend my time doing independent research, trying to improve the state-of-the-art in ML, and tinkering with emerging technologies.

Key interests:

- Transformers, VAEs, multimodality.
- More broadly - LLMs, diffusion, RL, SSL.
- Improving capabilities via mechanistic interpretability
- Classical ML algorithms and their modern variants
- Software architecture and system design
- Performance optimization and distributed systems
- DevOps and automation

You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avramdjo) if you have any interesting ideas or opportunities.
